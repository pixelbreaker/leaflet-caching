### Leaflet Map Cachine tests

To install you need to [install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) `node` then make sure you have `bower` installed.

run `npm install bower -g`.

Once you have cloned this project using
```
git clone ....
```

Run `npm run setup` once that has completed, run the app with `npm start`.
That will open a browser once the local server is up and running.

Happy mapping.
